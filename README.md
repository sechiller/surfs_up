## Surfs Up Analysis Summary

Both June and December have mild weather and the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year round. 

It may be helpful to look at wind and tide conditions as that impacts surf. It also may be helpful to correlate rain and temperature as some people might not want ice cream if it is colder and raining. Sunrise and sunset time may also inform business hours in the winter vs the summer.
